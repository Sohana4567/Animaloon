			<p class="mx-auto wstyles text-center mb-sm-5 mb-4">3000 Animals die ever second in slaughterhouses around the world. That’s 180,000 every minute. That’s 10,800,000 every hour.These numbers are mind-blowing and WE are contributing to this!

Each year, more than 8 billion chickens are killed for food. They’re shackled upside down and their throats are slit, though some birds miss the blade and are instead scalded alive. Chickens are exempted from the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act.So. After seeing all of this. After feeling guilty for the amounts of animals I have consumed over my lifetime, I made the decision not to eat meat for the month of September. They say if you can do something for 21 days straight it becomes a habit. Well, I’m doing it. Because I love animals, and I don’t want to be the cause of them being hurt. I might only be one person in a sea of millions, no, billions of people, but I want to be the change I want to see in the world. It starts with you. The change starts with yourself.</p>
